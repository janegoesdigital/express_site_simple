# What is this?
This is the first application I have created using express, mongoose, mongodb and jade (which should now be called pug I've discovered!)  It uses as its base my pending trip to the USA, and has one model - trips.  The CRUD routes are set up, and it works to save/retrieve things from the mongodb on my local machine.   

I used this tutorial to work my way through  setting it up:  [How to Create a Complete Express.js + Node.js + MongoDB CRUD and REST Skeleton by Kendrick Colemant]( https://www.airpair.com/javascript/complete-expressjs-nodejs-mongodb-crud-skeleton).  It was really helpful.

I did it!!!! Woo hoo!!!
